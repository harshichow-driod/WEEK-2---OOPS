# Week 2 â€“ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) â€“ BridgeLabz Fellowship

This repository contains Java programs and assignments from **Week 2** of the **BridgeLabz Fellowship Program**, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java.

## ðŸ“˜ Topics Covered

- **Classes and Objects**: Understanding the blueprint of Java programs and instantiation.
- **Constructors**: Parameterized and default constructors for object initialization.
- **Inheritance**: Implementing code reusability through class hierarchies.
- **Polymorphism**: Method overloading and overriding for dynamic behavior.
- **Encapsulation**: Data hiding using access modifiers and getters/setters.
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and interfaces to define contracts.

## âœ… Best Practices Followed

- Adherence to Java naming conventions.
- Modular code with single-responsibility methods.
- Comprehensive inline comments for clarity.
- Input validation and exception handling where applicable.
